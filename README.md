# Phase I: Too High? Too Low? Who knows.
Begin by creating a folder called guessing-game-project. Open the folder in VSCode. Inside of that folder create a guessing-game.js file. This is the file where we will do all of the coding.

Begin by initializing a variable in the global scope named secretNumber to any positive integer. Later we will program this variable to be assigned at random, but for now we'll hard-code a value that we can test for quickly.

## checkGuess
Define a function named checkGuess that accepts a number as an argument. It should compare that argument against the global secretNumber. It should have the following behavior:

when the argument is larger than secretNumber, it should print 'Too high.' and return false
when the argument is smaller than secretNumber, it should print 'Too low.' and return false
when the argument is equal to secretNumber, it should print 'Correct!' and return true
Let's take a moment to verify that our code is working as intended. Make a few test calls to checkGuess in the global scope. Be sure to use a range of numbers so we can verify that it behaves properly in all three scenarios. You'll want to console.log the return values of checkGuess since it should return booleans. Run your code with node guessing-game.js. When you are positive that your function is working, remove the test calls from your file.

## askGuess
Since we will be taking user input during gameplay, we'll need to do some standard setup for Node's readline module. Reference the readline docs to create an interface for input and output that we will use. To stay organized, we recommend that you import the module and create the interface at the tippy top of your file.

Define a function named askGuess. The method should use the readline module's question method to ask the user to 'Enter a guess: '. If you need a refresher on how to use this method, check out the question docs. Once the user enters their number, the checkGuess function should be called with their number as an argument and the interface should be closed.

When accepting user input, there is a very important nuance to take into account. When the user enters their guess it will be interpreted as a string of numeric characters and not an actual number type! Depending on how you wrote your checkGuess function, this could be disastrous because:

console.log(42 === "42"); // false
To overcome this issue, we should explicitly turn their guess into a number before we pass it into checkGuess. You can do this by calling the Number function. Here's an example of Number in action:

let str = "42";
console.log(42 === Number(str)); // true
Test your askGuess by calling it once in the global scope. Then run your program a few times, entering different numbers. After trying a single guess, you will have to run the program again. Be sure to include an attempt with a correct guess by entering the secretNumber value that you hard-coded.

Once you have verified that the user's guess is being properly checked, let's work on having the function ask the user for another guess if they are incorrect. Refactor the askGuess method with some conditional logic. Recall that the checkGuess function returns a boolean - very convenient! Here is how the askGuess function should flow:

check the user's guess
  - if it is correct, print out 'You win!' and close the interface
  - if it is incorrect, call askGuess again
You may find it a bit startling that you can reference the askGuess function from within the askGuess function. That is, you can a reference a function from within itself! This self-referential mechanism is leveraged quite frequently in programming. We will return to this concept in later lessons.

Run your program and test it out, being sure that you have a single call to askGuess in the global scope so the game can begin. Woohoo! We now have our minimal viable product (MVP) version of the game.
